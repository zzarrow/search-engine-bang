##Bang! search engine##

####This is a search engine created as a final project in an Internet & Web Systems class.  It is called Bang!.####

Bang! ran on Amazon's EC2 cloud and crawled, indexed, and PageRanked the web.  The front-end is built as a servlet on top of my Java Application Server, available in my [multi-threaded-application-server repository](https://github.com/zzarrow/multi-threaded-application-server) .  Bang! provides options for including Yahoo! search results and Amazon.com product results.
